zip files	can	be	protected	with	passwords,	which	are	intended	to	make	their	contents	
inaccessible	unless	you	know	the	password	with	which	the	.zip was	encrypted.	There	is	
no	limit	to	the	number	of	times	you	can	try	different	passwords	however,	so	someone	who	
did	not	know	the	password	could	theoretically	try	every	possible	password	until	they	find	
the	correct	one.	This	is	the	idea	behind	a	brute-force	password	cracker,	which	is	the	focus	of	
this	project.
For	this	project,	you	have	been	provided	(on	Pilot)	with	an	external	library	called	
zip4j-1.3.2.jar,	which	contains	some	handy	classes	that	will	help	you	interface	with	
.zip files.	You	will	need	to	unzip	(i.e.	expand)	this	file	before	you	can	use	it.	On	most	
operating	systems	you	can	do	this	just	by	double-clicking	on	the	file.	You	have	also	been	
provided	with	some	starter	code	called	Example.java that	tries	a	single	password	on	an	
encrypted	zip	file.
